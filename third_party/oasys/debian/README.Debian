Building an oasys package for Debian
------------------------------------

This debian package does not conform to any of the real Debian
policies or guidelines, but it's been included here for convenience.

Make sure you have debuild, debhelper, and fakeroot installed.

The process used to build the debian packages is:

First update the debian/changelog, typically using:
dch -v <version>

Then check in the updated changelog and create a release tag
containing the update.

Then export a snapshot of the release tag using:
hg archive -r <release_tag> -d ../oasys-<version>

Now cd .. and run
dpkg-source -b oasys-<version>

cd oasys-<version> && debuild -r fakeroot binary

Then, to buld an apt repository, the following commands were used,
where debian_version is the release name (i.e. sarge/etch) of the
target system:

reprepro -b <repository_dir> includedeb <debian_version> \
	 liboasys-<version>_<arch>.deb

reprepro -b <repository_dir> includedeb <debian_version> \
	 liboasys-dev-<version>_<arch>.deb

reprepro -b <repository_dir> -S contrib -P optional \
	 includedsc <debian_version> liboasys_<version>.dsc
