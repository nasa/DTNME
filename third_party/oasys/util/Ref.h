 * signature:
 *
 * <code>
 * void add_ref(const char* what1, const char* what2);
 * void del_ref(const char* what1, const char* what2);

 * For example, see the RefCountedObject class.

 * stored in the reference. Note that what1 is mandatory and is
 * typically the function name or object class that is holding the
 * reference. What2 is any other additional information used to
 * distinguish the instance.
