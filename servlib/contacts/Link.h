/**
 * Abstraction for a DTN link, i.e. a one way communication channel to
 * a next hop node in the DTN overlay.
 *
 * The state of a link (regarding its availability) is described by
 * the Link::state_t enumerated type.
 *
 * All links in the OPEN state have an associated contact that
 * represents an actual connection.
 *
 * Every link has a unique name associated with it which is used to
 * identify it. The name is configured explicitly when the link is
 * created.
 *
 * Creating new links:
 * Links are created explicitly in the configuration file. Syntax is:
 * @code
 * link add <name> <nexthop> <type> <conv_layer> <args>
 * @endcode
 * See servlib/cmd/LinkCommand.cc for implementation of this TCL cmd.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Links are of three types as discussed in the DTN architecture
 * ONDEMAND, SCHEDULED, OPPORTUNISTIC.
 *
 * The key differences from an implementation perspective are "who"
 * and "when" manipulates the link state regarding availability.
 *
 * ONDEMAND links are initializd in the AVAILABLE state, as one would
 * expect. It remains in this state until a router explicitly opens
 * it.
 *
 * An ONDEMAND link can then be closed either due to connection
 * failure or because the link has been idle for too long, both
 * triggered by the convergence layer. If an ONDEMAND link is closed
 * due to connection failure, then the contact manager is notified of
 * this event and periodically tries to re-establish the link.
 *
 * For OPPORTUNISTIC links the availability state is set by the code
 * which detects that there is a new link available to be used. 
 *
 * SCHEDULED links have their availability dictated by the schedule
 * implementation.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Links are used for input and/or output. In other words, for
 * connection-oriented convergence layers like TCP, a link object is
 * created whenever a new connection is made to a peer or when a
 * connection arrives from a peer.
