/**
 * All convergence layers that maintain a connection (i.e. a TCP
 * socket) to next hop peers derive from this base class. As such, it
 * manages all communication to/from the main bundle daemon thread,
 * handles the main thread of control for each connection, and
 * dispatches to the specific CL implementation to handle the actual
 * wire protocol.
 
 * The design is as follows:
 *
 * Open links contain a Connection class stored in the Contact's
 * cl_info slot. The lifetime of this object is one-to-one with the
 * duration of the Contact object. The Connection class is a thread
 * that contains a MsgQueue for commands to be sent from the bundle
 * daemon. The commands are SEND_BUNDLE, CANCEL_BUNDLE, and
 * BREAK_CONTACT. When in an idle state, the thread blocks on this
 * queue as well as the socket or other connection object so it can be
 * notified of events coming from either the daemon or the peer node.
 *
 * To enable backpressure, each connection has a maximum queue depth
 * for bundles that have been pushed onto the queue but have not yet
 * been sent or registered as in-flight by the CL. The state of the
 * link is set to BUSY when this limit is reached, but is re-set to
 * AVAILABLE if By default, there is no hard limit on the number of
 * bundles that can be in-flight, instead the limit is determined by
 * the capacity of the underlying link.
 *
 * The hardest case to handle is how to close a contact, as there is a
 * race condition between the underlying connection breaking and the
 * higher layers determining that the link should be closed. If the
 * underlying link breaks due to a timeout or goes idle for an on
 * demand link, a ContactDownEvent is posted and the thread
 * terminates, setting the is_stopped() bit in the thread class. In
 * response to this event, the daemon will call the close_contact
 * method. In this case, the connection thread has already terminated
 * so it is cleaned up when the Contact object goes away.
 *
 * If the link is closed by the daemon thread due to user
 * configuration or a scheduled link's open time elapsing, then
 * close_contact will be called while the connection is still open.
 * The connection thread is informed by sending it a BREAK_CONTACT
 * command. Reception of this command closes the connection and
 * terminates, setting the is_stopped() bit when it is done. All this
 * logic is handled by the break_contact method in the Connection
 * class.
 *
 * Finally, for bidirectional protocols, opportunistic links can be
 * created in response to new connections arriving from a peer node.
