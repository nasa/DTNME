 * The BundleRouter is the main decision maker for all routing
 * decisions related to bundles.
 *
 * It receives events from the BundleDaemon having been posted by
 * other components. These events include all operations and
 * occurrences that may affect bundle delivery, including new bundle
 * arrival, contact arrival, timeouts, etc.
 *
 * In response to each event the router may call one of the action
 * functions implemented by the BundleDaemon. Note that to support the
 * simulator environment, all interactions with the rest of the system
 * should go through the singleton BundleAction classs.
 *
 * To support prototyping of different routing protocols and
 * frameworks, the base class has a list of prospective BundleRouter
 * implementations, and at boot time, one of these is selected as the
 * active routing algorithm. As new algorithms are added to the
 * system, new cases should be added to the "create_router" function.
 *
 * This class can either run as its own separate thread or if not 
 * started then will process events immediately when called.
