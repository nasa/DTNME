 * This is the base class for BundleLists which can be of various 
 * flavors such as a std::list, std::map, etc. This class implements
 * the common elements of the lists.
 *
 * The internal data structure of Bundle pointers will vary in the
 * derived classes. The list is derived from Notifier, and the various 
 * push() calls in the derived classes must call notify() if there is 
 * a thread blocked on an empty list waiting for notification.
 *
 * List methods also maintain mappings (i.e. "back pointers") in each
 * Bundle instance to the set of lists that contain the bundle.
 *
 * Lists follow the reference counting rules for bundles. In
 * particular, the push*() methods increment the reference count, and
 * erase() decrements it. In particular, the pop() variants (as well
 * as the other accessors) return instances of the BundleRef classes
 * that forces the caller to use the BundleRef classes as well in
 * order to properly maintain the reference counts.
