/**
 * List structure for handling bundles.
 *
 * All list operations are protected with a spin lock so they are
 * thread safe. In addition, the lock itself is exposed so a routine
 * that needs to perform more complicated functions (like scanning the
 * list) must lock the list before doing so.
 *
 * NOTE: It is important that no locks be held on any bundles that
 * might be contained within the list when calling list manipulation
 * functions. Doing so could cause a potential deadlock due to a lock
 * ordering violation, as the list manipulation routines first lock
 * the list, and then lock the bundle(s) being added or removed. 
 *
 * The internal data structure is an STL list of Bundle pointers. The
 * list is also derived from Notifier, and the various push() calls
 * will call notify() if there is a thread blocked on an empty list
 * waiting for notification.
 *
 * List methods also maintain mappings (i.e. "back pointers") in each
 * Bundle instance to the set of lists that contain the bundle.
 *
 * Lists follow the reference counting rules for bundles. In
 * particular, the push*() methods increment the reference count, and
 * erase() decrements it. In particular, the pop() variants (as well
 * as the other accessors) return instances of the BundleRef classes
 * that forces the caller to use the BundleRef classes as well in
 * order to properly maintain the reference counts.
 *
