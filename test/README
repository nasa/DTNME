DTNME Testing Code
-----------------

Most of the files in this directory are .tcl scripts used for test
configuration of the DTNME daemon. The dtn-test.tcl file in turn
includes the bulk of the other utilities, and the main.tcl file is the
base bootstrap config that is typically sourced by the other test
files. For example, see send-one-bundle.tcl.

When using this test infrastructure, the daemon can be configured to
fork off a set of peer nodes, all of which will communicate over
loopback aliases.

Additionally, the following subdirectories contain other test code:

unit_tests: 
   Small C programs that exercise parts of the DTNME code base.
   Running 'make test' in this directory should build all the test 
   applications, depositing binaries in the unit_tests subdirectory.

comparison: 
   Test programs and scripts used for comparing the DTNME implementation
   to a simple 'ftp' style application and sendmail.

mail:
   Configuration used for the comparison to sendmail / smtp.
